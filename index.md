Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Bradley Diep and I've recently graduated from CSUF with a Bachelor's Degree in computer science. When I'm not coding, I usually draw, watch shows, play video games, or just hang out with my friends. 

I've always had a passion for drawing and designing things so I decided to apply my passion into computer science. When I started out as a freshman at CSUF, I was convinced that CS was just not cut out for me and that I should have been an animation major instead. I was genuinely struggling with concepts and it felt like I was falling behind everyone else. However, I decided to continue pursuing CS coursework and discovered that CS was actually pretty neat. I learned about HTML, CSS, game design, and other CS topics related to my passion for drawing and design. I'm still not an expert at them, but I'm willing to learn more to grow with my current coding knowledge. I'm open for any opportunities to enhance my career and abilities. <br> <br>

# Projects/Coursework
### Programming Languages:  
C++, Python, HTML, CSS, X86 Assembly, Javascript

### [Hungry Helpers](https://github.com/Midknightsnack/Hungry_Helpers)
Hungry Helpers is a group project that I worked on and it's a food planner web application that allows users to plan their meals. In the project, I worked on creating a clickable calendar where clicking on a date would present the user with a modal. Users can use that modal to plan out the meals they have throughout the day. It's currently incomplete and not as ambitious as I wanted it to be, but I like how it turned out so far.

### [Burger Bistro](https://github.com/Midknightsnack/CPSC-254-Project)
Burger Bistro is another group project that I worked on and it utilizes the GTK library to make the GUI in a Linux environment. It's a made-up restaurant with features that any other fast food restaurant has, but the catch is that this restaurant has a deluxe menu rather than a dollar menu. This means that the user is encouraged to spend more for the food. In this project, I was in charge of creating the menu and a search feature where the user can search for any item on the menu. For example, if the user typed "chicken" in the search bar, items with chicken in them will display.

### [how-to-html](https://github.com/Midknightsnack/how-to-html)
This was the first open source project that I created, and it's a compilation of various things that can be coded in HTML. I thought this project would be a great open source repository for beginners of HTML and CSS to work on.

### [Space Invaders](https://github.com/Midknightsnack/Space_Invaders)
This was a project that I did for my game design class and it's a recreation of the classic game, Space Invaders. The game was made using Pygame and my professor provided most of the code so that the game can function correctly. In this project, I had to stylize the game by adding sounds and designing alien sprites using sprite editors. I also had to adjust the ship, alien, and laser functionalities to make the game feel balanced.
